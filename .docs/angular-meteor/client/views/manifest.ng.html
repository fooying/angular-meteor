# Angular-Meteor Manifest

## General

### Don’t choose one solution

Developers tend to think they need to choose one solution - Meteor or AngularJS.

When they understand they can use Angular-Meteor, they think they need to choose between Blaze or AngularJS.

We disagree. We created this library so you could use **both Blaze and AngularJS** in the same application and even on the same page, template or directive.

You can start with AngularJS and migrate your application slowly to Blaze.
You can start using Blaze and move slowly to AngularJS.
You can use both of them together forever.

### A combined power

Both frameworks have missing parts: we found that they complement each other, creating a more complete solution.

By combining both tools we are **merging both communities**, for greater power over existing solutions.

As we sit in the middle, we see ways both frameworks can make their API’s more open for other frameworks. We're **making both frameworks more open and integrate-able**.


### Neutrality

Meteor and AngularJS are two advanced, very popular JavaScript frameworks with very strong development teams behind them.

Both frameworks have agendas and marketing teams. They believe in their mission and need to make money for the guys who pay for their development.
Most of the core team developers in each framework haven't used the other framework.

Developers who use one of the frameworks are naturally more comfortable with the technology they are familiar with.

We are here to be neutral.

## Why use AngularJS on top of Meteor

### MVC and MVVM structure

In Meteor’s client, everything is global. AngularJS is great with structuring large applications

AngularJS DOM syntax makes it easier to place the view login in the view and the app logic in JS.

If you still want to use global variables, Meteor is still there for you - as is Angular’s `$rootScope`.

### Running few applications on the same Meteor server

Angular’s modularity makes it easier to run few separate client applications on the same Meteor server.

### Ecosystem and community

* AngularJS community is huge and very mature. They have solutions for almost any requirement you can think of -
local storage, forms, UI components, calendars, maps and of course many more.
* There are a lot of other frameworks that works great with AngularJS - e.g. React, Famo.us, Ionic Framework, ngCordova.
* The amount of the community’s code inside AngularJS core code is substantial, and the framework core is very easy to look into and pull request.

### Learning curve

* AngularJS introduces a lot of new concepts for Meteor developers like directives, dependency injection and filters. Some of those might be hard for a starting developer. Those concepts are important for a lot of use cases, but if you want to keep it simple, you don’t have to learn them.
* It is hard to believe that a framework with such a steep learning curve would grow so fast in 2 years, but it has.
* Events - for some, handling events on top of HTML makes the code much more readable and easy than handling it in the javascript code like
the JQuery concept.

### The “Extending HTML” approach is taken also by browsers, standards and Polymer

### Code sharing

As AngularJS is not intrusive and can work inside other technologies, using it gives you the possibility to share code and knowledge with other frameworks besides Meteor.

### Future

Angular 2.0 - Angular’s team chose to rewrite the whole framework for its version 2.0.
As it sounds scary, we appreciate the courage and it gives a lot of room for the framework to become a lot better while still holding the huge experience with the existing code.
There are not a lot of frameworks that have the commitment and audacity to do that.

## Why use Meteor with AngularJS


### All the possibilities of a server without compromising the easiness

Two of Meteor core principles that you can actually see when developing with it:

1. Nothing in Meteor should harm the experience of a new Meteor developer - building an app with Meteor is as fast and easy as it gets.
2. Nothing in Meteor should preclude an expert from doing what they want - Meteor is not similar to Firebase. Meteor is a full blown server, you can do much more in Meteor than in Firebase.

### Super easy, Real-time integration with the database

### Very easy and comfortable build process

### Automatic Latency compensation with local minimongo on the client

### Amazing tools for working with Cordova applications

### Ecosystem - Like AngularJS, Meteor is also built from combining a lot of separate, individual packages written by the core team and the community:
Accounts and permissions, Search, sorting and pagination from client until the server, underscore, client and server router and much more.

### Easy deployment

## Should I use Angular-Meteor or Asteroid

Asteroid is a very interesting solution on top of Meteor. It separates the client side completely from Meteor so that you can take an existing front-end solution and still use Meteor reactivity and methods.

In Asteroid you are missing Meteor’s client side abilities like using Blaze templates, latency compensation and minimongo and the Cordova support.

With Asteroid you need to choose and can’t use both AngularJS and Blaze.
